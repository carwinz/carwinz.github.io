      <p>Once I started to save some money, I quickly found that I didn't know what to do with my savings - besides leaving it in a savings account. I read a lot of books and articles, but a lot of them were just trying to sell me something and few actually told the whole story about what they were promoting.</p>
      <p>Still, I learned what I could and tried out some things. I'm still learning, but I see other people starting out who might benefit from what I've learned.  What follows is an attempt to present a no-nonsense, simple introduction to investing based on what I've learned. </p>
      <p>Note that I do not have an Australian Financial Services Licence, so I am not able to give you financial advice and none of this should be taken as advice for you - it is simply my learnings. </p>
      <h4>Why Invest?</h4>
      <p>This is different for everyone. Some people want to be rich. Others want to liberated from the time-suck that is work. </p>
      <p>For me, I'm working towards a comfortable retirement and being able to supply family. I'm not convinced the pension is sustainable and I don't want to be miserly in my old age. </p>
      <h4>How can one invest money?</h4>
      <p>There are many ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Term deposits </li>
        <li>Commodities </li>
        <li><a href="shares.html">Shares</a></li>
        <li>Bonds </li>
        <li>Property </li>
        <li>Business </li>
        <li>And moreâ€¦ </li>
      </ul>
      <p>I will explore some of these in detail in future articles, but I believe your mindset is the most important part of any investment. <a href="mindset.html">Let's start there</a>.</p>
